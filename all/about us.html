             The National Geographic Society has joined with other conservation partners across the globe as part of the Wyss Campaign for Nature. On October 31, 2018, the Wyss Foundation announced it would donate an unprecedented $1 billion to this campaign to protect our planet’s lands and ocean and ensure that future generations can drink clean water, breathe clean air, and experience the wonders of the natural world.The campaign’s goal is to help conserve 30 percent of the planet in a natural state by 2030 by creating and expanding protected areas, establishing ambitious international conservation targets, investing in science, and inspiring conservation action around the world. Only by dramatically increasing the capacity of communities, indigenous peoples, and nations to conserve lands, waters, and wildlife can we hope to safeguard the natural world upon which we all depend.

             A healthier and greener choice of protecting the environment is to go by walking or bicycle to nearby places. The pollution caused by toxic substances released from vehicles will impact the surroundings adversely.Vehicle pollution is one of the major causes of the increase in global warming rates. The usage of petrol and diesel for the effective functioning of vehicles and the harsh chemicals released from the combustible fuel will pollute the fresh air.So, an alternative option is to use cycles. Carpooling is an evolving technique in today’s world. Utilizing the car for a single person is a waste of money and energy.If more than three people want to reach the same area, they can use the same car by sharing the amount of gas; This is an effective method to prevent air pollution.Further, protecting the environment in everyday life can be done by using less paper. A large number of trees are cut down for manufacturing papers. Using digital media rather than print media is one alternative.
